     Now it's your turn to write updateCreatures. Declare the method in Grid.h, create it in Grid.m. You will need to create a double-nested for-loop like we did in countNeighbors to access every creature in the Grid. Look over the code in countNeighbors if you need a refresher on how to do that.
     
     Next you need to create an if/else if statement. In the if statement, check if the Creature's livingNeighbors property is set to 3. If it is, that means it has 3 live neighbors so you want to set its isAlive property to TRUE. In the else if you want to check if the Creature has less than or equal to 1 living neighbors or more than or equal to 4. If either are true, set the Creature's isAlive property to FALSE.
